## Argonaut

This project serves as a playground as well as an example or template for a microservice with domain driven design.

An Argonaut is a member of a ship's crew in the adventurous Jason saga in ancient Greece. They visited many places and meet many people.

So, the aim of the project Argonaut is to mark and describe your personal interesting places on a map during your adventures.
